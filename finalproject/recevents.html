Ponce City Market, off the iconic Ponce de Leon Avenue, is one of our favorite destinations here in Atlanta. In 2014, an old, abandoned Sears building was converted to the mixed-use center that is now known as Ponce City Market. You and your family could easily get lost, spending an entire day here considering the many things to explore at Ponce City Market. Starting with the restaurants and bars, Ponce City Market has some of the best restaurants and bars (as well as a winery) in the city of Atlanta with many different kinds of food, ranging from burgers, italian, ramen, sushi, and many more. On top of this, Ponce City Market also has quite a few stores inside that sell a ton of different things like vintage clothing, books, art, jewelry, and even a candy store. Our personal favorite at Ponce City Market is Honeysuckle Gelato with one of the best desserts in the whole city that'll definitely satisfy your sweeth tooth! The buildings main attraction is definitely the rooftop, an iconic destination in Atlanta that is pictured above. The rooftop has an 18-hole minigolf course, boardwalk style games, and an amazing view of the city. We could go on and on about Ponce City Market but we'll leave it for you and your family to explore. </b></p>
