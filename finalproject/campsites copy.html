                                <p><b>Taking a look at a different style of camping, Timberline Glamping Company takes our number two spot with its spin on camping, "glamping". Glamping is "glamorous camping" and offers more luxurious accommodations and facilities than traditional camping typically does. Timberline Glamping Company has many different locations all over northeastern Georgia, such as Lake Lanier, Amicalola Falls, Lake Blackshear, Unicoi State Park, and more! With Timberline Glamping Company guests have many different accomodations to choose from, like tents with one king bed, one queen bed, or even two queen beds. Most tents they offer have their own Keurig coffe maker, mini fridge, ceiling fans, and residential heating and air conditioning. On top of all that, every "glampsite" comes with hammocks, a wood fire ring, a charcoal grill, camp chairs, and picnic tables! Even though Timberline Glamping Co. differs from traditional camping, we felt it necessary to give them the second spot on this list, as this combines camping and luxury in the perfect fashion.</b></p>
